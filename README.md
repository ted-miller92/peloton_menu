# Peloton Menu

I copied someone's script to make a basic menu page that shows images of the menus. A conveniently placed QR code could land here. 

When updating the menu, just be sure to keep the same file name, OR refactor the HTML to reflect the new file name.

The script creates two node lists of the buttons and the menu images. It's a little hacky because the two node lists aren't associated in any way BUT the handleClick function sort of treats it like they are associated. As long as the order of the images and buttons match in the HTML document, this should work. Adding new images won't break anything.  

## Mobile

This looks better on mobile than on desktop. `ctrl + shift + m` in firefox to toggle mobile view.
